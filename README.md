# BoxClicker

A small OpenGl application sample to showcase pixel shading and object picking. The program creates a scene with a red cube shaped button in the middle. Clicking on the cube will spawn random blue cubes in a predetermined grid around the red cube and clicking on a blue cube will make it disappear. Mouse scrollwheel also makes the camera zoom in and out. A light source exists at the top of the cubes and the cubes are created using instancing.
